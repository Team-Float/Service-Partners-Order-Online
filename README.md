### User Stories
 
 - As a customer, I want to be able to create an account on the ordering site, so I can place orders.
 - As store owner, I want only customers who currently have an account at my store to be able to create a new account, so that only verified customers can order from me.
 - As a customer I want to be able to log in and log out of this site, so that my information is secure.
 - As a customer, I would like to be able to add items to a cart, so that I can keep track of all the materials I am ordering.
 - As a sales rep, I want customers to order items only in specific multiples, so that a customer cannot order 25 feet of 10 foot downspout.
 - As a customer, I want to be able to edit the items in my cart, so that I can increase or decrease my order before I submit it.
 - As a customer, I want to be able to delete items from my cart, so that I am not stuck with materials I do not (or no longer) need.
 - As a customer, I want to be able to checkout once I have finished with my order, so that my order can be ready at the store when I arrive.
 - As a customer, I want to be able to review my order before it is finalized, so that I can make last minute changes or spot errors.
 - As a sales rep, when a customer orders on the site I want to receive and emailed version of their order, so that I can enter the order for pick up.
 - As a sales rep, I only want to see the customer id, the item codes and quantities, so that I can enter the order more quickly.
 - As a customer, I want to know about the company I am ordering from, so that I know they are a trust-worthy supplier.
